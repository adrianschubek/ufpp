# Blocks

A (template) block can be declared by using one or more `$[<command>]$` statements where `<command>` is a valid command (see API reference below) and must end in a `$[end]$` statement. 

A block's statements are evaluated from top to bottom. If the result of a command is truthy, the guarded section will be outputted and all other commands in this block ignored. 

Otherwise this statement will be skipped and the next statement is evaluated. If no statement in this block is truthy, the `else` section will be outputted and if no `else` section is present, nothing will be outputted.

There can be any number of blocks declared in a file, but blocks **cannot** be nested.
