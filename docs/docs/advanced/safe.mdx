# Safe Mode

When using a wide glob pattern (such as `*/**`), utpp may match files that you don't want to be processed like compiled binaries etc.
This could result in the following errors if utpp tries to match a pattern in them:

```
foo.txt: Command '$[�u�`�F�C���2���%�bԪ]$' found but it is not part of any block.
foo.txt: Found 1 unmatched commands. Please check your syntax.
```

or

```
bar.txt: Command '�Z��C��9�' does not exist.
```

To prevent this, you can use the `--safe` flag. This will cause utpp to only process files that contains the string `///utpp` anywhere in the file.
This is a good way to ensure that utpp only processes files that you want it to if you are unable to restrict your glob pattern.
All occurances of `///utpp` will be removed from the file.

### Ignore unkown commands

As an alternative to safe mode, you can use the `--ignore-unknown` flag. This will cause utpp to ignore any commands that it doesn't recognize.
If a command is not recognized in a block, the entire block will be ignored (unchanged).

:::caution
Typos in commands will be ignored with this flag and no error will be thrown. This could result in unwanted behavior.
:::

:::info
This flag only checks for unkown **commands**, not variables.
