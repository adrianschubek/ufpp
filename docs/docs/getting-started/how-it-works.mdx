# How it works

For every file the following steps are performed:

```mermaid
graph LR;
    a(Read file)-->b[Apply template]-->c[Apply variables]-->e(Write file);
```

## 1. Read file

The file is read from the filesystem and stored in memory.

```x title="> cat foobar.txt"
The answer is ${{´40+2´}}
$[ifeq foo bar]$
Hello ${{foo}}$
$[else]$
Bye
$[end]$
```

## 2. Apply template

The commands will be evaluated and applied to the file. 

```x title="> utpp --no-vars foobar.txt foo=bar"
The answer is ${{´40+2´}}
Hello ${{foo}}$
```

## 3. Apply variables

The variables are applied to the template. The variables are a key-value pair that contains the values to replace in the template.

```x title="> utpp foobar.txt foo=bar"
The answer is 42
Hello bar
```

## 4. Write file

The file is written to the filesystem or to the standard output depending on the cli arguments.
